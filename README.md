Current Questions / Issues:

1. story submit form works when I have it set to on("click", function...), but not when I have it set to on("submit") and I don't understand why. 
Same goes for login form which wasn't code that I wrote so it should work and it doesn't. 

2. favorites is not set up in a way that works - you can add and remove favorites, but the stars aren't always accurate and they don't stay as 
a filled in star when the page refreshes. This part still needs work. 

3. the remove functionality seems to be working behind the scenes, but the UI isn't updated to remove the story once it's removed and I don't 
understand why, so I don't know how to make that work. When the page refreshes, the story is gone, but not until that time. 

4. started setting up ability to edit stories, but didn't finish, so there is defintely extraneous code in the files related to editing stories...
